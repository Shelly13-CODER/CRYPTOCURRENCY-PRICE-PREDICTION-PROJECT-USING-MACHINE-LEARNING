# CRYPTOCURRENCY-PRICE-PREDICTION-PROJECT-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptographic protocol. It is not bound or backed  by any government and works on a peer-to-peer system. Bitcoin is the world’s most valuable  cryptocurrency introduced following the release of a white-paper published in 2008 under the pseudo name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is very different from traditional financial markets. Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming rivals to traditional currency across the world. The digital  currencies are available to purchase in many different places, making it accessible to everyone, and  with retailers accepting various cryptocurrencies it could be a sign that money as we know it is about  to go through a major change. In addition, the blockchain technology on which many cryptocurrencies are based, with its  revolutionary distributed digital backbone, has many other promising applications. Implementations of secure, decentralized systems can aid us in conquering organizational issues of trust and security that  have plagued our society throughout the ages. In effect, we can fundamentally disrupt industries core to economies, businesses and social structures, eliminating inefficiency and human error. A rising market should see rising volume. Buyers require increasing numbers and increasing  enthusiasm in order to keep pushing prices higher. Increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest, and this is a warning of a potential reversal. This can be hard to wrap your mind around, but the simple fact is that a price drop (or rise) on little volume is not a strong signal. A price drop (or rise) on large volume is a stronger signal that something in the stock has fundamentally changed


• Specifications
The project deeply focuses on the Slug category which means name of the crypto currency along 
with the

➢ Symbols, including more than 1400 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum 
etc.

➢ Volume is a measure of how much of a given financial asset has been traded in a given period
of time and even though so simple, it can be a powerful indicator fortrading.

➢ Open is the price of the stock at the beginning of the trading day (it need not be the closing
price of the previous trading day).

➢ High is the highest price of the stock on that Trading Day

➢ Low the lowest price of the stock on that Trading Day

➢ Close the price of the stock at closing time.

➢ Market, also known as Market Capitalization, is obtained by multiplying the circulating 
supply of coins by the current coin price. It is one way to rank the relative size of a 
cryptocurrency.

➢ Ranknow depicting the rank of each cryptocurrency starting from 1 to 1400

➢ Spread depicting the difference between the buying and selling price of a cryptocurrency

• Features
1. Currency Rates
The project shall cover widely a range of “High” and “Low” profiles of each 
cryptocurrency according to it’s
➢ Date Wise Rates
➢ Month Wise rates
➢ Prediction of the Cryptocurrency ratesin accordance to the duration mentioned in 
months
➢ Year Wise “Rise” and “Fall” Volume in the Stock Market Rates of the considered 
Currency Type.

2. Cryptocurrency Analysis
The project will widely range to Price Analysis using previous predictions with the 
concept of Supervised Learning and Next Strong Support Rate. It shall also include the 
chances of steady rate recovery of a certain cryptocurrency.

3. Technical Analysis
Technical analysis involves using statistical trends based on historical price activities. 
The technical analysis depends on the idea that crypto prices follow trends and repeats
themselves. Therefore, analystsfocus on examining the price movements and trading
volumesto forecast the future directions of crypto price, whether it will go up or fall in 
the future.

4. Fundamental Analysis
Instead of depending on the historical price trends, fundamental analysis takes a different 
approach. It analyses the factors that contribute to the changing price trends. It focuses 
on the fact that the value of a cryptocurrency can be both undervalued or overvalued, and 
then it is time to make corrections.

5. Cryptocurrency Forecasting Analysis
➢ ARIMA Model
(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
ARIMAmodels are denoted withthe notation ARIMA (p,d, q). These parameters accountfor
seasonality,trend, and noise in datasets:
p - the number of lag observations to include in the model, or lag order. (AR)
d - the number oftimesthatthe raw observations are differenced, orthe degree of differencing.
5
q - the size of the moving average window, also called the order of moving average (MA).
A linear regression model is constructed including the specified number and type of terms, and the
data is prepared by a degree of differencing in order to make it stationary, i.e. to remove trend 
and seasonal structures that negatively affect the regression model. A value of 0 for a parameter
indicatesto not use that element ofthe model.
➢ ParameterSelection
We will iteratively explore different combinations of parameters. For each combination we 
fit a new ARIMA model and assess its overall quality. We will use the AIC (Akaike Information 
Criterion) value, returned with ARIMA models fitted using statsmodels. The AIC measures how
well a model fitsthe data while taking into account the overall complexity of the model. A model 
that fits the data very well while using lots of features will be assigned a larger AIC score than a
model that uses fewer featuresto achieve the same goodness-of-fit. Therefore, we are interested in 
finding the model that yields the lowest AIC value.
